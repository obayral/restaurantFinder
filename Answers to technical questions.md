1)How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I have spent around 5-6 hours to the coding test. I would add some more functionalities to my solution such as displaying reviews or ranking of the restaurants, if I had more time.

2)What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

I have used React.js and the newest version of React is 16.8. With this version, hooks are available. They are useful for 
using state and other React features without writing a class, however I haven't used them in  my solution.

3)How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?

I would consult to the network admins to run stats for run stats for network traffic between the various servers. I also,
communicate with DBA regarding the run stats and reports for the a certain time period in order to analyze how does the application perform. I have never had to do this since applications in the proeduction environment had never received serious 
complaints about the "fastness" of the application.


4)How would you improve the API that you just used?

I could improve some more extra functionalities, such as diplaying reviews, enabling the user to like the restaurant or leave a review, I could add a search bar and implement an AJAX call and make the user able to type the city instead of providing 4 cities.

5)Please describe yourself using JSON.

Both in my professional and academic experiences, I have used JSON in various projects and I feel comfortable with JSON as it is well-organized and easy to understand data format. Therefore handling with nested elements or big files is not a problem. Hence, I like to use JSON and I use JSON in my applications.
